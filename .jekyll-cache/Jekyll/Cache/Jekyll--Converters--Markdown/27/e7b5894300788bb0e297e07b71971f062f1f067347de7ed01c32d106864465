<p>The blog template supports posts in nested sub-folders. This helps in organisation and can be used to group posts of similar content e.g. a multi-part series. This post is itself an example of a nested route! Itâ€™s located in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/data/blog/nested-route</code> folder.</p>

<h2 id="how">How</h2>

<p>Simplify create multiple folders inside the main <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/data/blog</code> folder and add your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.md</code>/<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.mdx</code> files to them. You can even create something like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/data/blog/nested-route/deeply-nested-route/my-post.md</code></p>

<p>We use Next.js catch all routes to handle the routing and path creations.</p>

<h2 id="use-cases">Use Cases</h2>

<p>Here are some reasons to use nested routes</p>

<ul>
  <li>More logical content organisation (blogs will still be displayed based on the created date)</li>
  <li>Multi-part posts</li>
  <li>Different sub-routes for each author</li>
  <li>Internationalization (though it would be recommended to use <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/i18n-routing">Next.js built-in i8n routing</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="note">Note</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The previous/next post links at bottom of the template are currently sorted by date. One could explore modifying the template to refer the reader to the previous/next post in the series, rather than by date.</li>
</ul>
